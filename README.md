# TOPSIS Analysis

## Multi-Criteria Decision Making Using TOPSIS

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

## Introduction

TOPSIS is a widely used technique for solving MCDM problems. It is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).

## Features

- Calculation of weighted normalized decision matrix
- Determination of positive and negative ideal solutions
- Calculation of separation measures
- Calculation of relative closeness to the ideal solution
- Ranking of alternatives

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArmaanChahal/MCDM-using-topsis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd MCDM-using-topsis
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook topsis.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the TOPSIS analysis.

## Example

The notebook includes a detailed example with a dataset. You can modify the dataset and weights according to your requirements.
